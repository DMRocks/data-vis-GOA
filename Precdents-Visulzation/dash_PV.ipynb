The Constitution endows a citizen with certain rights, and it is the Supreme Court's duty to assess if laws, made by the government, violate these rights. For example, these rights include the freedom of religion, speech, press or assembly. Yet, these rights are so absolute in practice. A citizen has freedom of speech, but can they use that to spread communist propaganda during war times? Can a citizen spread hate speech online? Can they encourage others to commit violent acts?

The United States when founded was plagued by the question of state rights vs the Federal Government. After the war, the Federal Government’s power rose more and more. Consequently, there was more jurisdiction allocated to the Court and more cases. Another trend to point out is the issue of the “First Amendment.” In war-time, the United States often finds it needed to limit the right to freedom of speech and press. So, these cases go up to the Supreme Court, and often, the court finds that the government is in their power to limit speech in times of war. This is illustrated in the start of the Vietnam War. The United States at this time was afraid of communism spreading through the country, so to prevent the spread commust idea or the war on communism. The first amendment was limited. When the Soviet Union dissolved, these fears went down and we can see first amendment cases lower in numbers.\")\n",
