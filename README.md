# Hodgepodge Data Visualization

In this file is a collection of my [GOA](https://globalonlineacademy.org/) Data Visualization course. 

In here you will find a comparison of a comparison of agriculture and income, mapping of genetically engineered crops in the US, tracking landmine area, Olympic Rowing Stats and a visualization of Supereme Court cases.

There are two files/folders in each folder. A "main" Python Notebook which was used to get the data transformed and ready, and a final "dash" file to deploy to Dash.
